- 👋 Hi, I’m Rojan, you can also call me Rory :)
- 👀 I’m interested in Games (mostly open-world and story games; e.g. Red Dead Redemption 2 is my all time favorite game and I have beaten the game multiple times!) and Art (I do 3D designing sometimes and I paint/draw a lot), Music, and Coding (obviously!).
- 🎆 I enjoy challenging myself and pushing my limits
