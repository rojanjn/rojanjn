- 👋 Hi, I’m Rojan, you can also call me Rory :)
- 👀 I’m into in Games (mostly open-world and story-driven ones. _**Red Dead Redemption 2**_ is my all-time favorite, and I've beaten the game multiple times!), art (I love painting and drawing a lot. I also dabble into 3D design.), music, and coding (obviously!).
- 🎆 I enjoy challenging myself and pushing my limits
